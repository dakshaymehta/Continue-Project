# Continue-Project

Something I used Continue for: 

#1 Checking if code was efficient to begin with:

This really helped me analyze the next steps, and reassured me that I'm on the right path in terms of quality, and would love to keep using continue in order to do that 🫡

#2 Completing code Snippets right in the IDE, was pretty time-saving and helped me stay in my work FLOW 👀 ⏰

I love the comments and explanation that it makes at the end of what this code snippet does for the project going forward. 

#3 Having the Copy/Paste feature right in the IDE:

I don't have to have multiple Chrome tabs opened for stack overflow, GitHub repos, and ChatGPT, and I don't need to have multiple monitors in order to copy-paste code 😂, it's all right here, there are a lot of steps that have been omitted that help in productivity and concentration for the project.
